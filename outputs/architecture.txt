Here is the detailed explanation of each component and its purpose:

1. **User**: The user interacts with the system through various interfaces, such as the web interface or mobile app.
2. **API Gateway** (`API`): Acts as an entry point for all requests from users. It handles CRUD operations, authentication, and routing to other components.
3. **Task Manager** (`TaskManager`): Responsible for managing tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations. It also handles task categorization by course and recurring task scheduling.
4. **Course Manager** (`CourseManager`): Manages courses related to tasks, providing the necessary information for task categorization.
5. **Scheduling Service** (`SchedulingService`): Generates recurring task instances based on user-defined frequencies and schedules notifications for approaching deadlines.
6. **Notification Queue** (`NotificationQueue`): Manages notification sending, ensuring that notifications are sent in a timely manner.
7. **Calendar Integration** (`CalendarIntegration`): Integrates with calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar) to provide seamless task management.
8. **Email Integration** (`EmailIntegration`): Integrates with email clients (e.g., Outlook) to provide email-based notifications and reminders.

The system architecture is designed using a microservices architecture, where each component has a specific responsibility and communicates with other components through well-defined interfaces. This allows for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the system.

Justification for architectural decisions:

* Using a microservices architecture allows for better scalability, as each component can be scaled independently.
* Separating concerns by using distinct components (e.g., Task Manager, Course Manager) improves maintainability and reduces complexity.
* Implementing scheduling and notification services separately from the task management service ensures that these critical functions are handled reliably and efficiently.

This system architecture provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive software system that meets the requirements specified.
