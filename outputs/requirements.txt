Here are the extracted functional and non-functional requirements:

**Functional Requirements**

| Description | Priority | Complexity | Expected Outcomes | Implementation Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. User can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks | High | Medium | Users can manage their task list, including adding new tasks, viewing existing ones, editing details, and deleting completed tasks. | Implement a RESTful API with CRUD operations for tasks. |
| 2. Tasks can be categorized by course | High | Medium | Users can group tasks by course, making it easier to prioritize and organize assignments. | Introduce a "Course" entity and establish relationships between tasks and courses using a many-to-many relationship. |
| 3. Recurring tasks for regular study sessions | High | Low | Users can set recurring tasks for daily or weekly study sessions, ensuring consistent progress tracking. | Implement a scheduling algorithm to generate recurring task instances based on user-defined frequencies. |
| 4. Task prioritization and ordering | Medium | Low | Users can reorder tasks by priority, ensuring the most important ones are addressed first. | Develop a sorting algorithm to prioritize tasks based on their assigned priority levels. |
| 5. Deadline tracking and reminders | High | Medium | Users receive timely reminders for upcoming deadlines, helping them stay on track. | Implement a scheduling algorithm to generate notifications for approaching deadlines. |
| 6. Task completion tracking and analytics | High | Medium | The application provides insights into task completion rates, helping users identify areas for improvement. | Develop a reporting module to generate task completion statistics, including average completion time, success rate, and frequency of task completion. |
| 7. User authentication and authorization | High | High | Only authenticated users can access their task list, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. | Implement OAuth or OpenID Connect for user authentication and authorization using a third-party library or custom solution. |
| 8. Task filtering and searching | Medium | Low | Users can quickly find specific tasks using filters (e.g., course, priority, deadline) and search functionality. | Develop a search algorithm that uses Lucene or Elasticsearch to index task attributes and provide efficient querying capabilities. |
| 9. User profile management | Medium | Low | Users can manage their profiles, including setting preferences for reminders, notifications, and analytics. | Implement user profile management using a custom entity and relationships with other entities (e.g., tasks, deadlines). |
| 10. Error handling and logging | Medium | Low | The application provides detailed error logs to facilitate debugging and issue resolution. | Develop an error handling mechanism that captures exceptions, logs relevant information, and notifies administrators of issues. |
| 11. Task assignment and delegation | Medium | High | Users can assign tasks to others (e.g., study partners) or delegate tasks for group projects. | Introduce a "Task Assignment" entity and establish relationships between tasks, users, and assignments using many-to-many relationships. |
| 12. Task dependencies and blockers | Medium | High | Users can identify task dependencies and blockers, enabling better planning and decision-making. | Implement a dependency management system that tracks task relationships and provides insights into blocked or dependent tasks. |
| 13. Customizable dashboard and widgets | Low | High | Users can personalize their dashboard with relevant widgets (e.g., upcoming deadlines, task lists) for improved productivity tracking. | Develop a widget framework using a JavaScript library (e.g., React, Vue.js) to create customizable dashboards. |
| 14. Notification center and filtering | Medium | Medium | Users receive notifications about task updates, reminders, and analytics insights, which can be filtered by type or priority. | Implement a notification system that uses a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) for efficient notification processing. |
| 15. Integration with calendar and email | Low | High | The application integrates with the user's calendar and email client to provide seamless task management. | Develop integrations using APIs or webhooks for popular calendar and email services (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook). |

**Non-Functional Requirements**

| Description | Priority | Complexity | Expected Outcomes | Implementation Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. User Interface Usability | High | Medium | The application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and understand. | Conduct usability testing and gather feedback from users to inform UI design decisions. Use a responsive design framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for cross-platform compatibility. |
| 2. Performance and Scalability | High | High | The application handles increasing traffic and user loads without compromising performance or availability. | Implement load balancing, caching, and queuing mechanisms using a cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud). |
| 3. Security and Data Protection | High | High | The application ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data, adhering to industry standards for security and compliance. | Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data, use secure protocols for communication (e.g., HTTPS), and follow best practices for authentication and authorization. |
| 4. Accessibility and Inclusivity | Medium | Low | The application provides equal access to users with disabilities, adhering to accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1). | Use an accessibility framework (e.g., WAI-ARIA) to provide assistive technologies for users with disabilities. Conduct accessibility testing and gather feedback from users with disabilities. |
| 5. Documentation and Support | Low | Medium | The application provides clear documentation, tutorials, and support resources to help users get started and overcome issues. | Develop a comprehensive knowledge base (e.g., wiki) with tutorials, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides. Offer online support channels (e.g., chat, email) and maintain a community forum for user engagement. |

Note that these requirements are not exhaustive, and the project may require additional functional or non-functional requirements to be defined based on further analysis and stakeholder feedback.
